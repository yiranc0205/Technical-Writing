# Basic Style Guide
## Well Organized Content

p.s. Introduce each list and table with a ***following*** sentence, such as:

## Conciseness
- Avoid redundancies
- Link to information instead of copying text
- Add visuals (graphics, diagrams, screenshots...) - don't use text all the time

replacements for a few common bloated phrases:

| Wordy | Concise |
| :---- | :---- |
|start again|restart|
|at this point of time|now|
|determine the location of|find|
|is able to|can|
|cause the triggering of|trigger|
|provide a detailed description of|describe/detail|
|enhance the clarification|clarify|

## Simplicity
- Use simple language and grammar
- Use short sentences - don't use long and complex sentences
- Use positive formulations ("to do what" instead of "not to do what")
- Don't use long series of noun modifier
- Use AmE or BrE according to your company

## Precision
- Write **true information** (!)

- Use correct product or component names

# Verb Choice
## Use precise, strong verbs
Choose strong, specific verbs, such as:
- change
- save
- delete
- import
- create

Reduce weak, generic verbs, such as: 
- forms of *be*: is, are, am, was, were, etc.
- occur
- happen
- maintain

Example sentences:

- may/might = possible state or outcome

## Modal verbs
- must = absolute requirement

- may = optional

## Minimize adjectives and adverbs
Use factual, objective data or information instead of loosely defined and marketing adv. or adj.

> ✗   Setting this flag makes the application run **screamingly fast**.
