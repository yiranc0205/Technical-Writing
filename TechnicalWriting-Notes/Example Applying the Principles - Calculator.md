Write an instruction that will let a beginner user start the calculator application on your mobile phone using the principles above:

1. Who are you writing for?
My target user is *an end user with no experience using calculator apps*. I call the persona 'Nick'.

2. What information does my user need?
Nick needs to figure out *how to start the application, to know what it can do for him and how to use it*.

3. I am going to use my company *Style Guide*. I will use a *friendly, informal writing style*.

4. I am going to develop an *End-User Guide deliverable in HTML output format* to make it easy to find on the Internet.

5. I shall create my instructions using *Wiki GitHub wiki*, as a simple tool for writing and sharing my content.

6. I shall structure my content in the following way:
	*a. Features Overview - what can you do with this application.
	b. Tasks with arithmetic operations in the following order: how to add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers.
	c. Reference list with the multiplication table, as I've heard customers often ask about it.*
